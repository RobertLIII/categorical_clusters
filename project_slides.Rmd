```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```



# Previously...
- Clusters clearly defined (subject $i$)
- Explanatory vs outcome also clearly defined
- Euclidean distances mostly make sense


# Now...
- Identify the clusters
  - $k$ clusters
  - The data decides
- Explanatory vs outcome not necessarily clear
- Difference measurements between categorical variables (dummy variables)
  - $p$ binary variables
  
  
# New slide

# Code Chunk - New Slide
```{r code_chunk, results='markup'}
# write function/R code here
# code_chunk is a unique name for the code_chunk; so change it to make clear like a comment
# if you do not want the results posted onto a slide, change to results="hide"
# in-text code can be written like `r function()` using the function name instead of function()
```
